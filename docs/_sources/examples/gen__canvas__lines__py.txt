This demonstrates the experimental and unfinished
SmoothLine feature for fast line drawing. You
should see a multi-segment path at the top of the
screen, and sliders and buttons along the bottom.
You can click to add new points to the segment,
change the transparency and width of the line, or
hit 'Animate' to see a set of sine and cosine
animations. The Cap and Joint buttons don't work:
SmoothLine has not implemented these features yet.
