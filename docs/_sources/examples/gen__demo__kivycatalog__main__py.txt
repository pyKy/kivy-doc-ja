The Kivy Catalog viewer showcases widgets
available in Kivy and allows interactive editing
of kivy language code to get immediate feedback.
You should see a two panel screen with a menu
spinner button (starting with 'Welcome') and other
controls across the top.The left pane contains
kivy (.kv) code, and the right side is that code
rendered. You can edit the left pane, though
changes will be lost when you use the menu spinner
button. The catalog will show you dozens of .kv
examples controlling different widgets and
layouts.

The catalog's interface is set in the file
:ref:`kivycatalog.kv
<demo_kivycatalog_kivycatalog.kv>`, while the
interfaces for each menu option are set in
containers_kvs directory. To add a new .kv file to
the Kivy Catalog, add a .kv file into the
container_kvs directory and reference that file in
the ScreenManager section of kivycatalog.kv.
