This shows how to implicitly use a .kv file for
your application. You should see a full screen
button labelled "Hello from test.kv".

After Kivy instantiates a subclass of App, it
implicitly searches for a .kv file. The file
:ref:`test.kv <application_test.kv>` is selected
because the name of the subclass of App is
TestApp, which implies that kivy should try to
load "test.kv". That file contains a root Widget.
