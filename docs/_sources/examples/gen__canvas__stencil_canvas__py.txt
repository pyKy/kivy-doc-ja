This is a test of the stencil graphics instruction
inside the stencil view widget. When you use a
stencil, nothing will be drawn outside the
bounding box. All the graphics will draw only in
the stencil view.

You can "draw" a stencil view by touch & draw. The
touch down will set the position, and the drag
will set the size.
