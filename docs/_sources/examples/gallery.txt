    This gallery lets you explore the many examples included with Kivy.
    Click on any screenshot to see the code.

This gallery contains:

    * Examples from the examples/ directory that show specific capabilities of
      different libraries and features of Kivy.
    * Demonstrations from the examples/demos/ directory that explore many of
      Kivy's abilities.

There are more Kivy programs elsewhere:

    * Tutorials_ walks through the development of complete Kivy applications.
    * Unit tests found in the source code under the subdirectory kivy/tests/
      can also be useful.

We hope your journey into learning Kivy is exciting and fun!

|                      | This example demonstrates using OpenGL to display  |
|                      | a rotating monkey head. This includes loading a    |
|                      | Blender OBJ file, shaders written in OpenGL's      |
|                      | Shading Language (GLSL), and using scheduled       |
|                      | callbacks.                                         |
|                      |                                                    |
|                      | The monkey.obj file is an OBJ file output from the |
|                      | Blender free 3D creation software. The file is     |
|                      | text, listing vertices and faces and is loaded     |
|                      | using a class in the file objloader.py. The file   |
|                      | simple.glsl is a simple vertex and fragment shader |
|                      | written in GLSL.                                   |
|                      |                                                    |

|                      | This example demonstrates creating and applying a  |
|                      | multi-part animation to a button widget. You       |
|                      | should see a button labelled 'plop' that will move |
|                      | with an animation when clicked.                    |
|                      |                                                    |

|                      | This explores different methods of starting an     |
|                      | application. If you run this without a command     |
|                      | line parameter, you should see a menu in your      |
|                      | terminal. You can also run this with a 'r'         |
|                      | parameter to pick a random method. There are lots  |
|                      | of logging options to make this easier to debug:   |
|                      | the execution order may not be obvious. Each time  |
|                      | you run the command, only one kivy application is  |
|                      | created.                                           |
|                      |                                                    |
|                      | This uses the file testkvfile.kv and the file      |

|                      | An application can be built if you return a widget |
|                      | on build(), or if you set self.root.               |

|                      | This shows how to implicitly use a .kv file for    |
|                      | your application. You should see a full screen     |
|                      | button labelled "Hello from test.kv".              |
|                      |                                                    |
|                      | After Kivy instantiates a subclass of App, it      |
|                      | implicitly searches for a .kv file. The file       |
|                      | test.kv is selected because the name of the        |
|                      | subclass of App is TestApp, which implies that     |
|                      | kivy should try to load "test.kv". That file       |
|                      | contains a root Widget.                            |
|                      |                                                    |

|                      | This example shows how you can change the          |
|                      | directory for the .kv file. You should see "Hello  |
|                      | from template1/test.ky" as a button.               |
|                      |                                                    |
|                      | As kivy instantiates the TestApp subclass of App,  |
|                      | the variable kv_directory is set. Kivy then        |
|                      | implicitly searches for a .kv file matching the    |
|                      | name of the subclass in that directory, finding    |
|                      | the file template1/test.kv. That file contains the |
|                      | root widget.                                       |
|                      |                                                    |

|                      | This example demonstrates a simple use of the      |

|                      | 'play' to turn the camera on and off. Note that    |
|                      | not finding a camera, perhaps because gstreamer is |
|                      | not installed, will throw an exception during the  |

|                      | This example shows a closed Bezier curve computed  |
|                      | from a polygon. You should see a purple polygon, a |

|                      | two sliders. You can drag points on the polygon to |
|                      | recompute the curve. The two sliders control the   |
|                      | dash length of the dashed lines making up the two  |
|                      | shapes.                                            |

|                      | This example exercises circle (ellipse) drawing.   |
|                      | You should see sliders at the top of the screen    |
|                      | with the Kivy logo below it. The sliders control   |
|                      | the angle start and stop and the height and width  |
|                      | scales. There is a button to reset the sliders.    |

|                      | screen, and sliders and buttons along the bottom.  |
|                      | You can click to add new points to the segment,    |

|                      | mtexture2.png of an orange circle. You should see  |
|                      | an orange K clipped to a circle. It uses a custom  |
|                      | shader, written in glsl (OpenGL Shading Language), |

|                      | a label showing the current size. As you resize    |
|                      | the window, it stays an 8x8. This example includes |

|                      | This is a test of the stencil graphics instruction |

|                      | bounding box. All the graphics will draw only in   |

|                      | You can "draw" a stencil view by touch & draw. The |

|                      | The Kivy Catalog viewer showcases widgets          |
|                      | available in Kivy and allows interactive editing   |
|                      | of kivy language code to get immediate feedback.   |
|                      | You should see a two panel screen with a menu      |
|                      | spinner button (starting with 'Welcome') and other |
|                      | controls across the top.The left pane contains     |
|                      | kivy (.kv) code, and the right side is that code   |
|                      | rendered. You can edit the left pane, though       |
|                      | changes will be lost when you use the menu spinner |
|                      | button. The catalog will show you dozens of .kv    |
|                      | examples controlling different widgets and         |
|                      | layouts.                                           |

|                      | The catalog's interface is set in the file         |
|                      | kivycatalog.kv, while the interfaces for each menu |
|                      | option are set in containers_kvs directory. To add |
|                      | a new .kv file to the Kivy Catalog, add a .kv file |
|                      | into the container_kvs directory and reference     |
|                      | that file in the ScreenManager section of          |
|                      | kivycatalog.kv.                                    |

|                      | This application records gestures and attempts to  |
|                      | match them. You should see a black drawing surface |
|                      | with some buttons across the bottom. As you make a |
|                      | gesture on the drawing surface, the gesture will   |
|                      | be added to the history and a match will be        |
|                      | attempted. If you go to the history tab, name the  |
|                      | gesture, and add it to the database, then similar  |
|                      | gestures in the future will be recognized. You can |
|                      | load and save databases of gestures in .kg files.  |
