This example exercises circle (ellipse) drawing.
You should see sliders at the top of the screen
with the Kivy logo below it. The sliders control
the angle start and stop and the height and width
scales. There is a button to reset the sliders.
The logo used for the circle's background image is
from the kivy/data directory. The entire example
is coded in the kv language description.
