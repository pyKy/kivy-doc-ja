This example shows a closed Bezier curve computed
from a polygon. You should see a purple polygon, a
red bezier curve computed from the polygon, and
two sliders. You can drag points on the polygon to
recompute the curve. The two sliders control the
dash length of the dashed lines making up the two
shapes.
