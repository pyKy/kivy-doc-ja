msgid "The Kivy Catalog viewer showcases widgets available in Kivy and allows interactive editing of kivy language code to get immediate feedback. You should see a two panel screen with a menu spinner button (starting with 'Welcome') and other controls across the top.The left pane contains kivy (.kv) code, and the right side is that code rendered. You can edit the left pane, though changes will be lost when you use the menu spinner button. The catalog will show you dozens of .kv examples controlling different widgets and layouts."

To add a new .kv file to the Kivy Catalog, add a .kv file into the container_kvs directory and reference that file in the ScreenManager section of kivycatalog.kv."
