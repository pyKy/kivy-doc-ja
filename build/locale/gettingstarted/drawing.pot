msgid "You can add two types of instructions to the canvas: *context* instructions and *vertex* instructions. You can add instructions either from Python code or from the kv file (the preferred way). If you add them via the kv file, the advantage is that they are automatically updated when any property they depend on changes. In Python, you need to do this yourself."
