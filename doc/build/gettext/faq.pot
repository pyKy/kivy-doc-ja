The Kivy team feels that our python-for-android is the best solution for us going forward, and attempts to integrate with and support Py4A is not a good use of our time."

msgstr ""

msgid "Let us try to give a thorough answer; please bear with us."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:129
msgid "Python is a very agile language that allows you to do many things in a (by comparison) short time. For many development scenarios, we strongly prefer writing our application quickly in a high-level language such as Python, testing it, then optionally optimizing it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:135
msgid "But what about speed? If you compare execution speeds of implementations for a certain set of algorithms (esp. number crunching) you will find that Python is a lot slower than say, C++. Now you may be even more convinced that it's not a good idea in our case to use Python. Drawing sophisticated graphics (and we are not talking about your grandmother's OpenGL here) is computationally quite expensive and given that we often want to do that for rich user experiences, that would be a fair argument. **But**, in virtually every case your application ends up spending most of the time (by far) executing the same part of the code. In Kivy, for example, these parts are event dispatching and graphics drawing. Now Python allows you to do something to make these parts much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:150
msgid "By using Cython, you can compile your code down to the C level, and from there your usual C compiler optimizes things. This is a pretty pain free process and if you add some hints to your code, the result becomes even faster. We are talking about a speed up in performance by a factor of anything between 1x and up to more than 1000x (greatly depends on your code). In Kivy, we did this for you and implemented the portions of our code, where efficiency really is critical, on the C level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:159
msgid "For graphics drawing, we also leverage today's GPUs which are, for some tasks such as graphics rasterization, much more efficient than a CPU. Kivy does as much as is reasonable on the GPU to maximize performance. If you use our Canvas API to do the drawing, there is even a compiler that we invented which optimizes your drawing code automatically. If you keep your drawing mostly on the GPU, much of your program's execution speed is not determined by the programming language used, but by the graphics hardware you throw at it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:169
msgid "We believe that these (and other) optimizations that Kivy does for you already make most applications fast enough by far. Often you will even want to limit the speed of the application in order not to waste resources. But even if this is not sufficient, you still have the option of using Cython for your own code to *greatly* speed it up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:176
msgid "Trust us when we say that we have given this very careful thought. We have performed many different benchmarks and come up with some clever optimizations to make your application run smoothly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:182
msgid "Does Kivy support Python 3.x?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:184
msgid "Yes! As of version 1.8.0 Kivy supports both Python >= 2.7 and Python >= 3.4 with the same codebase. Python 3 is also now supported by python-for-android."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:188
msgid "However, be aware that while Kivy will run in Python 3.4+, our iOS build tools still require Python 2.7."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:193
msgid "How is Kivy related to PyMT?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:195
msgid "Our developers are professionals and are pretty savvy in their area of expertise. However, before Kivy came around there was (and still is) a project named PyMT that was led by our core developers. We learned a great deal from that project during the time that we developed it. In the more than two years of research and development we found many interesting ways to improve the design of our framework. We have performed numerous benchmarks and as it turns out, to achieve the great speed and flexibility that Kivy has, we had to rewrite quite a big portion of the codebase, making this a backwards-incompatible but future-proof decision. Most notable are the performance increases, which are just incredible. Kivy starts and operates just so much faster, due to these heavy optimizations. We also had the opportunity to work with businesses and associations using PyMT. We were able to test our product on a large diversity of setups and made PyMT work on all of them. Writing a system such as Kivy or PyMT is one thing. Making it work under all these different conditions is another. We have a good background here, and brought our knowledge to Kivy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:215
msgid "Furthermore, since some of our core developers decided to drop their full-time jobs and turn to this project completely, it was decided that a more professional foundation had to be laid. Kivy is that foundation. It is supposed to be a stable and professional product. Technically, Kivy is not really a successor to PyMT because there is no easy migration path between them. However, the goal is the same: Producing high-quality applications for novel user interfaces. This is why we encourage everyone to base new projects on Kivy instead of PyMT. Active development of PyMT has stalled. Maintenance patches are still accepted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you accept patches?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:231
msgid "Yes, we love patches. In order to ensure a smooth integration of your precious changes however, please make sure to read our contribution guidelines. Obviously we don't accept every patch. Your patch has to be consistent with our styleguide and, more importantly, make sense. It does make sense to talk to us before you come up with bigger changes, especially new features."

#: ../../sources/faq.rst:246
msgid "If you want to participate as a student and want to maximize your chances of being accepted, start talking to us today and try fixing some smaller (or larger, if you can ;-) problems to get used to our workflow. If we know you can work well with us, that'd be a big plus."

Show us you're serious about it and take initiative."
