This example shows a closed Bezier curve computed from a polygon. You should
see a purple polygon, a red bezier curve computed from the polygon, and two
sliders. You can drag points on the polygon to recompute the curve. The two
sliders control the dash length of the dashed lines making up the two shapes.
