This example exercises circle (ellipse) drawing. You should see sliders at the
top of the screen with the Kivy logo below it. The sliders control the angle
start and stop and the height and width scales. There is a button to reset the
sliders. The logo used for the circle's background image is from the kivy/data
directory. The entire example is coded in the kv language description.
