Cymunk is based on Chipmunk2d 6.x, recently Chipmunk 7 has released and brought many previously premium features into the core library. In addition to the API changes present in the newest Chipmunk, the KivEnt - Cymunk bridging does not make most efficient use of the KivEnt API for handling C level objects and data.

msgid "The KV language is a fundamental component of Kivy. The KV language allows one to describe a GUI; from the creation of a Widget tree to the actions that should be taken in response value changes and events. In effect it is a concise way to create rule bindings using the Kivy properties and events. Internally, python code that reflects these rules are created and bound to the properties and events. Currently, these bindings are not at all optimized because upon each widget creation all of these rules are re-evaluated and bound. This process can be significantly optimized by pre-compiling the kv code, especially the bindings. A compiler would also allow us to update and fix some of the long-standing kv language issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/gsoc.rst:231
msgid "Work on a kv-compiler has already progressed quite far, in fact a PR in the pre-alpha stage, is currently open. However, it is out of sync with the current codebase due to some unrelated kv changes in the meantime. Also, that PR would require a significant re-write to make things more modular, self-contained, and extensible. So there is much work still to be done on it."
