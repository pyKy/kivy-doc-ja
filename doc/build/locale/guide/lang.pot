msgid "As your application grow more complex, it's common that the construction of widget trees and explicit declaration of bindings, becomes verbose and hard to maintain. The `KV` Language is a attempt to overcome these short-comings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/lang.rst:13
msgid "The `KV` language (sometimes called kvlang, or kivy language), allows you to create your widget tree in a declarative way and to bind widget properties to each other or to callbacks in a natural manner. It allows for very fast prototyping and agile changes to your UI. It also facilitates a good separation between the logic of your application and its User Interface."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/lang.rst:361
msgid "When your kv file is parsed, kivy collects all the widgets tagged with id's and places them in this `self.ids` dictionary type property. That means you can also iterate over these widgets and access them dictionary style::"

We can create the UI around the ``Controller`` class in a file named `controller.kv`, which will be loaded when we run the ``ControllerApp``. How this is done and what files are loaded is described in the :meth:`kivy.app.App.load_kv` method."
