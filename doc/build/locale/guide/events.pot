msgid "Events are an important part of Kivy programming. That may not be surprising to those with GUI development experience, but it's an important concept for newcomers. Once you understand how events work and how to bind to them, you will see them everywhere in Kivy. They make it easy to build whatever behavior you want into Kivy."

msgid "Introduction to the Event Dispatcher"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:21
msgid "One of the most important base classes of the framework is the :class:`~kivy.event.EventDispatcher` class. This class allows you to register event types, and to dispatch them to interested parties (usually other event dispatchers). The :class:`~kivy.uix.widget.Widget`, :class:`~kivy.animation.Animation` and :obj:`~kivy.clock.Clock` classes are examples of event dispatchers."

msgid "Main loop"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:34
msgid "As outlined in the illustration above, Kivy has a `main loop`. This loop is running during all of the application's lifetime and only quits when exiting the application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:38
msgid "Inside the loop, at every iteration, events are generated from user input, hardware sensors or a couple of other sources, and frames are rendered to the display."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:42
msgid "Your application will specify callbacks (more on this later), which are called by the main loop. If a callback takes too long or doesn't quit at all, the main loop is broken and your app doesn't work properly anymore."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:46
msgid "In Kivy applications, you have to avoid long/infinite loops or sleeping. For example the following code does both::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:53
msgid "When you run this, the program will never exit your loop, preventing Kivy from doing all of the other things that need doing. As a result, all you'll see is a black window which you won't be able to interact with. Instead, you need to \"schedule\" your ``animate_something()`` function to be called repeatedly."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:111
msgid "The -1 is mostly used when you are already in a scheduled event, and if you want to schedule a call BEFORE the next frame is happening."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:114
msgid "A second method for repeating a function call is to first schedule a callback once with :meth:`~kivy.clock.Clock.schedule_once`, and a second call to this function inside the callback itself::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:124
msgid "While the main loop will try to keep to the schedule as requested, there is some uncertainty as to when exactly a scheduled callback will be called. Sometimes another callback or some other task in the application will take longer than anticipated and thus the timing can be a little off."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:129
msgid "In the latter solution to the repetitive callback problem, the next iteration will be called at least one second after the last iteration ends. With :meth:`~kivy.clock.Clock.schedule_interval` however, the callback is called every second."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:148
msgid "This way of programming a trigger is expensive, since you'll always call unschedule, even if the event has already completed. In addition, a new event is created every time. Use a trigger instead::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sources/guide/events.rst:156
msgid "Each time you call trigger(), it will schedule a single call of your callback. If it was already scheduled, it will not be rescheduled."
