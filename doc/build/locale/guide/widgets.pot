Default size_hint (1, 1) will make every child the same size as the whole layout, so you probably want to change this value if you have more than one child.

That is because |BoxLayout| controls the |size_hint_y| when |orientation| is `vertical` and |size_hint_x| when |orientation| is 'horizontal'. The controlled dimension's size is calculated depending upon the total no. of |children| in the |BoxLayout|. In this example, one child has |size_hint_y| controlled (.5/.5 = 1).
