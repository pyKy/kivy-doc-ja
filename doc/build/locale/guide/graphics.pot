msgid "Canvasses can contain two subsets of instructions. They are the :mod:`canvas.before <kivy.graphics.Canvas.before>` and the :mod:`canvas.after <kivy.graphics.Canvas.after>` instruction groups.  The instructions in these groups will be executed before and after the :mod:`~kivy.graphics.canvas` group respectively. This means that they will appear under (be executed before) and above (be executed after) them. Those groups are not created until the user accesses them."
