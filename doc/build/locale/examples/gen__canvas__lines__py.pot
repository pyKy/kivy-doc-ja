msgid "This demonstrates the experimental and unfinished SmoothLine feature for fast line drawing. You should see a multi-segment path at the top of the screen, and sliders and buttons along the bottom. You can click to add new points to the segment, change the transparency and width of the line, or hit 'Animate' to see a set of sine and cosine animations. The Cap and Joint buttons don't work: SmoothLine has not implemented these features yet."
