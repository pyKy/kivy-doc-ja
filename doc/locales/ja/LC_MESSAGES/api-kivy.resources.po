"Resource management can be a pain if you have multiple paths and "
"projects. Kivy offers 2 functions for searching for specific resources "

"When Kivy looks for a resource e.g. an image or a kv file, it searches "
"through a predetermined set of folders. You can modify this folder list "
"using the :meth:`resource_add_path` and :meth:`resource_remove_path` "
"functions."

"These functions can also be helpful if you want to replace standard Kivy "
"resources with your own. For example, if you wish to customize or re-"
"style Kivy, you can force your *style.kv* or *data/defaulttheme-0.png* "
"files to be used in preference to the defaults simply by adding the path "
"to your preferred alternatives via the :meth:`resource_add_path` method."

"As almost all Kivy resources are looked up using the "
":meth:`resource_find`, so you can use this approach to add fonts and "
"keyboard layouts and to replace images and icons."
