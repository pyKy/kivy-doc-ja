"This module implements behaviors that can be `mixed in "

#: kivy.uix.behaviors:12 of
msgid ""
"Isolating these properties and events in a mixin class allows you to "
"define your own implementation for standard kivy widgets that can act as "
"drop-in replacements. This means you can re-style and re-define widgets "
"as desired without breaking compatibility: as long as they implement the "
"behaviors correctly, they can simply replace the standard widgets."
