"The screen manager is a widget dedicated to managing multiple screens for"
" your application. The default :class:`ScreenManager` displays only one "
":class:`Screen` at a time and uses a :class:`TransitionBase` to switch "
"from one Screen to another."
msgstr ""

"Multiple transitions are supported based on changing the screen "

"Please note that by default, a :class:`Screen` displays nothing: it's "
