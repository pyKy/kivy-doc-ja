msgid "This module implements the Protractor gesture recognition algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:18 of
msgid ""
":class:`Recognizer` is the search/database API similar to "
":class:`~kivy.gesture.GestureDatabase`. It maintains a list of "
":class:`MultistrokeGesture` objects and allows you to search for a user-"
"input gestures among them."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:23 of
msgid ""
":class:`ProgressTracker` tracks the progress of a "
":meth:`Recognizer.recognize` call. It can be used to interact with the "
"running recognizer task, for example forcing it to stop half-way, or "
"analyzing results as they arrive."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:27 of
msgid ""
":class:`MultistrokeGesture` represents a gesture in the gesture database "
"(:attr:`Recognizer.db`). It is a container for :class:`UnistrokeTemplate`"
" objects, and implements the heap permute algorithm to automatically "
"generate all possible stroke orders (if desired)."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:32 of
msgid ""
":class:`UnistrokeTemplate` represents a single stroke path. It's "
"typically instantiated automatically by :class:`MultistrokeGesture`, but "
"sometimes you may need to create them manually."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:36 of
msgid ""
":class:`Candidate` represents a user-input gesture that is used to search"
" the gesture database for matches. It is normally instantiated "
"automatically by calling :meth:`Recognizer.recognize`."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:41 of
msgid "Usage examples"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.multistroke:46 of
msgid ""
"You can bind to events on :class:`Recognizer` to track the state of all "
