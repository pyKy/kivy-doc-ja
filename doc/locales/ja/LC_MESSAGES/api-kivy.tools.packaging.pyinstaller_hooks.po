"PyInstaller comes with a default hook for kivy that lists the indirectly "
"imported modules that pyinstaller would not find on its own using "
":func:`get_deps_all`. :func:`hookspath` returns the path to an alternate "
"kivy hook, ``kivy/tools/packaging/pyinstaller_hooks/kivy-hook.py`` that "
"does not add these dependencies to its list of hidden imports and they "
"have to be explicitly included instead."

"One can overwrite the default hook by providing on the command line the "

" hook will still run, the `important global variables "

"Additionally, one can add a hook to be run after the default hook by "
