msgid ""
"You don't really want to do this: it's more of an example of how to "
"construct gestures dynamically. Typically, you would need a lot more "
"points, so it's better to record gestures in a file and reload them to "
"compare later. Look in the examples/gestures directory for an example of "
"how to do that."
