"Tests are located in the `kivy/tests` folder. If you find a bug in Kivy, "
"a good thing to do can be to write a minimal case showing the issue and "
"to ask core devs if the behaviour shown is intended or a real bug. If you"
" write your code as a `unittest "
"<http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html>`_ , it will prevent the "
"bug from coming back unnoticed in the future, and wil make Kivy a better,"
" stronger project. Writing a unittest may be a really good way to get "
"familiar with Kivy while doing something useful."
