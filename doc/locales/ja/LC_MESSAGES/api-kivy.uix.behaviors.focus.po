"The :class:`~kivy.uix.behaviors.FocusBehavior` `mixin "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin>`_ class provides keyboard focus "
"behavior. When combined with other FocusBehavior widgets it allows one to"
" cycle focus among them by pressing tab. In addition, upon gaining focus,"
" the instance will automatically receive keyboard input."

"Focus, very different from selection, is intimately tied with the "
"keyboard; each keyboard can focus on zero or one widgets, and each widget"
" can only have the focus of one keyboard. However, multiple keyboards can"
" focus simultaneously on different widgets. When escape is hit, the "
"widget having the focus of that keyboard will de-focus."

"In essence, focus is implemented as a doubly linked list, where each node"
" holds a (weak) reference to the instance before it and after it, as "
"visualized when cycling through the nodes using tab (forward) or "
"shift+tab (backward). If a previous or next widget is not specified, "
":attr:`focus_next` and :attr:`focus_previous` defaults to `None`. This "
"means that the :attr:`~kivy.uix.widget.Widget.children` list and "
":attr:`parents <kivy.uix.widget.Widget.parent>` are walked to find the "
"next focusable widget, unless :attr:`focus_next` or "
":attr:`focus_previous` is set to the `StopIteration` class, in which case"
