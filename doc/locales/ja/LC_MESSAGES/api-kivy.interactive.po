"The Kivy API intends for some functions to only be run once or before the"
" main EventLoop has started. Methods that can normally be called during "
"the course of an application will work as intended, but specifically "
"overriding methods such as :meth:`on_touch` dynamically leads to trouble."

"After pressing *enter*, the script will return. This allows the "

":class:`App` can be done safely through the InteractiveLauncher instance "

"IPython provides a fast way to learn the Kivy API. The :class:`App` "

"All of the proxies used in the module store their referent in the "

"Both the :class:`InteractiveLauncher` and :class:`SafeMembrane` hold "

":meth:`SafeMembrane.safeIn` will cause the application to pause and "
":meth:`SafeMembrane.safeOut` will allow a paused application to continue "

"that need the screen to update etc."

"The :class:`InteractiveLauncher` can have attributes added to it exactly "
"like a normal object and if these were created from outside the membrane,"
