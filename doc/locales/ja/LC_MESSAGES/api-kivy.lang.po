"The Kivy language is a language dedicated to describing user interface "
"and interactions. You could compare this language to Qt's QML "
"(http://qt.nokia.com), but we included new concepts such as rule "
"definitions (which are somewhat akin to what you may know from CSS), "
"templating and so on."

"The Builder doesn't execute canvas expressions in realtime anymore. It "

"<BuilderBase.sync>`."

"A rule is similar to a CSS rule. A rule applies to specific widgets (or "

"You can use rules to specify interactive behaviour or use them to add "

"specific class of widgets (similar to the CSS concept of a *class*) by "

msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:253 of
msgid ""
"When you use the Kivy language, you might notice that we do some work "
"behind the scenes to automatically make things work properly. You should "
"know that :doc:`api-kivy.properties` implement the `Observer Design "
"Pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern>`_. That means "
"that you can bind your own function to be called when the value of a "
"property changes (i.e. you passively `observe` the property for potential"
" changes)."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:261 of
msgid ""
"The Kivy language detects properties in your `value` expression and will "
"create create callbacks to automatically update the property via your "
"expression when changes occur."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:265 of
msgid "Here's a simple example that demonstrates this behaviour::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:270 of
msgid ""
"In this example, the parser detects that `self.state` is a dynamic value "
"(a property). The :attr:`~kivy.uix.button.Button.state` property of the "
"button can change at any moment (when the user touches it). We now want "
"this button to display its own state as text, even as the state changes. "
"To do this, we use the state property of the Button and use it in the "
"value expression for the button's `text` property, which controls what "
"text is displayed on the button (We also convert the state to a string "
"representation). Now, whenever the button state changes, the text "
"property will be updated automatically."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:280 of
msgid ""
"Remember: The value is a python expression! That means that you can do "
"something more interesting like::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:286 of
msgid ""
"The Button text changes with the state of the button. By default, the "
"button text will be 'Plop world', but when the button is being pressed, "
"the text will change to 'Release me!'."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:290 of
msgid ""
"More precisely, the kivy language parser detects all substrings of the "
"form `X.a.b` where `X` is `self` or `root` or `app` or a known id, and "
"`a` and `b` are properties: it then adds the appropriate dependencies to "
"cause the the constraint to be reevaluated whenever something changes. "
"For example, this works exactly as expected::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:299 of
msgid ""
"However, due to limitations in the parser which hopefully may be lifted "
"in the future, the following doesn't work::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:305 of
msgid ""
"indeed the `.e.f` part is not recognized because it doesn't follow the "
"expected pattern, and so, does not result in an appropriate dependency "
"being setup. Instead, an intermediate property should be introduced to "
"allow the following constraint::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:316 of
msgid "Graphical Instructions"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:318 of
msgid ""
"The graphical instructions are a special part of the Kivy language. They "
"are handled by the 'canvas' property definition::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:329 of
msgid ""
"All the classes added inside the canvas property must be derived from the"
" :class:`~kivy.graphics.Instruction` class. You cannot put any Widget "
"class inside the canvas property (as that would not make sense because a "
"widget is not a graphics instruction)."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:334 of
msgid ""
"If you want to do theming, you'll have the same question as in CSS: which"
" rules have been executed first? In our case, the rules are executed in "
"processing order (i.e. top-down)."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:338 of
msgid ""
"If you want to change how Buttons are rendered, you can create your own "
"kv file and add something like this::"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:353 of
msgid ""
"This will result in buttons having a red background with the label in the"
" bottom left, in addition to all the preceding rules. You can clear all "
"the previous instructions by using the `Clear` command::"
msgstr ""

"Then, only your rules that follow the `Clear` command will be taken into "
"consideration."

#: kivy.lang:378 of
msgid ""
"Dynamic classes allow you to create new widgets on-the-fly, without any "
"python declaration in the first place. The syntax of the dynamic classes "
"is similar to the Rules, but you need to specify the base classes you "
"want to subclass."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:383 of
msgid "The syntax looks like:"

"The `@` character is used to separate your class name from the classes "
"you want to subclass. The Python equivalent would have been:"
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:408 of

"Any new properties, usually added in python code, should be declared "
"first. If the property doesn't exist in the dynamic class, it will be "
"automatically created as an :class:`~kivy.properties.ObjectProperty` (pre"
" 1.8.0) or as an appropriate typed property (from version 1.8.0)."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:416 of
msgid ""
"If the property value is an expression that can be evaluated right away "
"(no external binding), then the value will be used as default value of "
"the property, and the type of the value will be used for the "
"specialization of the Property class. In other terms: if you declare "
"`hello: \"world\"`, a new :class:`~kivy.properties.StringProperty` will "
"be instantiated, with the default value `\"world\"`. Lists, tuples, "
"dictionaries and strings are supported."
msgstr ""

#: kivy.lang:424 of

"Let's illustrate the usage of these dynamic classes with an "
"implementation of a basic Image button. We could derive our classes from "
