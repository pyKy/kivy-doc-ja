Kivy places this widget-tree in the default Window. In the next step, we will draw the Pong background and scores by defining how the ``PongGame widget`` looks."

We set the pos of the rectangle to be 5 pixels left of the horizontal center of the widget, and 0 for y. The size of the rectangle is set to 10 pixels in width, and the widget's height in height. The nice thing about defining the graphics like this, is that the rendered rectangle will be automatically updated when the properties of any widgets used in the value expression change."

The standard behaviour of the Window is to resize an element based on its property `size_hint`. The default widget size_hint is (1,1), meaning it will be stretched 100% in both x-direction and y-direction and hence fill the available space. Since the pos and size of the rectangle and center_x and top of the score labels were defined within the context of the ``PongGame`` class, these properties will automatically update when the corresponding widget properties change. Using the Kv language gives you automatic property binding. :)"

We'll hook that up to the actual score once we have the logic implemented, but the labels already look good since we set a bigger font_size, and positioned them relatively to the root widget.

This binding occurs because Kivy :mod:`~kivy.properties` automatically bind to any references in their corresponding kv files. When the ball escapes out of the sides, we'll update the score and serve the ball again by changing the ``update`` method in the ``PongGame`` class.
