"We would like to take a moment to explain how we designed Kivy from a "
"software engineering point of view. This is key to understanding how "
"everything works together. If you just look at the code, chances are you "
"will get a rough idea already, but since this approach certainly is "
"daunting for most users, this section explains the basic ideas of the "
"implementation in more detail. You can skip this section and refer to it "
"later, but we suggest at least skimming it for a rough overview."

"One idea that is key to understanding Kivy's internals is that of "
"modularity and abstraction. We try to abstract basic tasks such as "
"opening a window, displaying images and text, playing audio, getting "
"images from a camera, spelling correction and so on. We call these *core*"
" tasks. This makes the API both easy to use and easy to extend. Most "
"importantly, it allows us to use -- what we call -- specific providers "
"for the respective scenarios in which your app is being run. For example,"
" on OSX, Linux and Windows, there are different native APIs for the "
"different core tasks. A piece of code that uses one of these specific "
"APIs to talk to the operating system on one side and to Kivy on the other"
" (acting as an intermediate communication layer) is what we call a *core "
"provider*. The advantage of using specialized core providers for each "
"platform is that we can fully leverage the functionality exposed by the "
"operating system and act as efficiently as possible. It also gives users "
"a choice. Furthermore, by using libraries that are shipped with any one "
"platform, we effectively reduce the size of the Kivy distribution and "
"make packaging easier. This also makes it easier to port Kivy to other "
"platforms. The Android port benefited greatly from this."

"We follow the same concept with input handling. *An input provider* is a "
"piece of code that adds support for a specific input device, such as "
"Apple's trackpads, TUIO or a mouse emulator. If you need to add support "
"for a new input device, you can simply provide a new class that reads "
"your input data from your device and transforms them into Kivy basic "
"events."

"Kivy's graphics API is our abstraction of OpenGL. On the lowest level, "
"Kivy issues hardware-accelerated drawing commands using OpenGL. Writing "
"OpenGL code however can be a bit confusing, especially to newcomers. "
"That's why we provide the graphics API that lets you draw things using "
"simple metaphors that do not exist as such in OpenGL (e.g. Canvas, "
"Rectangle, etc.)."

"All of our widgets themselves use this graphics API, which is implemented"
" on the C level for performance reasons."

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:65
msgid ""
"Another advantage of the graphics API is its ability to automatically "
"optimize the drawing commands that your code issues. This is especially "
"helpful if you're not an expert at tuning OpenGL. This makes your drawing"
" code more efficient in many cases."

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:70

"You can, of course, still use raw OpenGL commands if you prefer. The "
"version we target is OpenGL 2.0 ES (GLES2) on all devices, so if you want"

"functions."

"Kivy abstracts different input types and sources such as touches, mice, "

"easily find a 2D position for e.g. a tilt of your device. This kind of "
"input is handled separately. In the following we describe the former "
"types.)"

"All of these input types are represented by instances of the Touch() "

"simplicity. Think of it of something that *touches* the user interface or"
" your screen.) A touch instance, or object, can be in one of three "
"states. When a touch enters one of these states, your program is informed"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:175
msgid ""
"The term *widget* is often used in GUI programming contexts to describe "
"some part of the program that the user interacts with. In Kivy, a widget "
"is an object that receives input events. It does not necessarily have to "
"have a visible representation on the screen. All widgets are arranged in "
"a *widget tree* (which is a tree data structure as known from computer "
"science classes): One widget can have any number of child widgets or "
"none. There is exactly one *root widget* at the top of the tree that has "
"no parent widget, and all other widgets are directly or indirectly "
"children of this widget (which is why it's called the root)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:185
msgid ""
"When new input data is available, Kivy sends out one event per touch. The"
" root widget of the widget tree first receives the event. Depending on "
"the state of the touch, the on_touch_down, on_touch_move or on_touch_up "
"event is dispatched (with the touch as the argument) to the root widget, "
"which results in the root widget's corresponding on_touch_down, "
"on_touch_move or on_touch_up event handler being called."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:193
msgid ""
"Each widget (this includes the root widget) in the tree can choose to "
"either digest or pass the event on. If an event handler returns True, it "
"means that the event has been digested and handled properly. No further "
"processing will happen with that event. Otherwise, the event handler "
"passes the widget on to its own children by calling its superclass's "
"implementation of the respective event handler. This goes all the way up "
"to the base Widget class, which -- in its touch event handlers -- does "
"nothing but pass the touches to its children::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:208
msgid ""
"This really is much easier than it first seems. An example of how this "
"can be used to create nice applications quickly will be given in the "
"following section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guide/architecture.rst:212
msgid ""
"Often times you will want to restrict the *area* on the screen that a "
"widget watches for touches. You can use a widget's collide_point() method"
" to achieve this. You simply pass it the touch's position and it returns "
"True if the touch is within the 'watched area' or False otherwise. By "
"default, this checks the rectangular region on the screen that's "
"described by the widget's pos (for position; x & y) and size (width & "
"height), but you can override this behaviour in your own class."
